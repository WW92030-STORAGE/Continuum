# Continuum
Terraria-esque housing system concept. Housing query item is made using 8 sticks and one redstone dust, in the same manner as a painting is made.<br/>
NOTE - Right now the process for spawning the NPC uses a dragon egg, so for your sanity's sake you should probably use something that lets you obtain more of them, such as this mod (not by me): https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/end-portal-recipe.
